Staring, improper sight.

Me friend and I were on our way back to our pg after an evening walk. Some guys in a group whistled at us

I went Bangalore for some personal work. One of my freind lives in Bangalore. When they get to know thsi she invited me at her house for dinner. I have to go back from night train. so i leave my friend house and waiting for cab. My cab driver was unable to find my location so i walk a little so that he can find my location. There was a corner of road where i was standing. One boy called me from behind, i answered yes, after that he started whistling and staring me which is very uncomfortable. I thought that this was not a goid palce let just move ahead. But the boys were soo rude they stopped my path by coming in front of me. I was very scared at that time. I take out my phone immediately and called my friend. The time i called her they all were ran away. After some time my cab also reached and i went for railway station.

A guy just randomly started talking to me in the bus station and then climbed into a bus with me, followed me home.

A guy was stalking me while I was walking alone and he tried to approach me

So I was walking down the road alone at around 1am and 2 people in a car followed me and made comments about the way I was dressed and about my body and tried to make me me get in their car

I got followed by a man who was masturbating and looking at time. Me and my friends were together and we quickly got into a cab and went home. It was very horrible and scary.

I was getting down from a bus station and walking back home when a girl standing nearby started staring at me and calling me - "Aaja raja" something like that.

I was recently interning at H3mart and my employer messaged me through his private number because I gave him the idea that I didn't mind being chill. Although that wasn't an invitation to cross the line and ask me if I would like good sex from him, even though I brushed him off and said I am there to work, he asked me to rethink and said it's "my loss, baby". But yes, I couldn't come out and tell anyone this because he is one of the co-founders and I didn't want to be kicked out or quit because I did nothing wrong.

I was going back home from college in the metro. I had to change my metro line so I got down at Majestic and had to walk to my platform. I was listening to music and was walking and a guy was sitting on one the chairs and suddenly reached his hand out and grabbed my waist and breast, I yelled and he thought it was a joke and he had a friend with him and because I made an issue, his friend jokingly hit him and said sorry. It was insensitive to say the least.

It was the beginning of this year and I was walking on the street, just one of the parallel streets near my house to buy groceries for mum .I would not call the timing I went out to be late cause it was still day time and two guys were on a scooty drunk, they had a bottle and one of them just hit my lady bump and screamed something nasty and drove off. It all happened in a fraction of second for me to figure what had happened and all I could see was 100 pairs of eyes on the street glaring at me nobody said or did anything.

He moved instantly. I was happy I could do something to him.

Wiretapping laws require consent,” says Ohio employment attorney Jonathan Hyman, a partner in the Labor & Employment Group at Kohrman Jackson & Krantz. “Therefore, employers cannot make recordings of telephone calls without consent. In single-party consent states, obtaining the employee’s consent is sufficient. In dual-consent states, however, the business must also inform the other party that the call may be monitored or recorded. The best practice is employee consent via a signed policy and notifying the other party as part of any phone call, to cover all bases,” he says. Interestingly, video surveillance has fewer restrictions, and these are generally concerned with the audio element. “There are no legal issues directly implicated by video recording, provided that the video surveillance does not offensively invade an employee’s privacy,” says Hyman. “State and federal wiretap laws do not cover pure video surveillance. As long as the surveillance is video-only (no sound), employers are generally okay.”

So much that I told my friends after we went back to our hostel about the incident.

Me and my friends were just going to buy a few things from the nearby store. Just when we were crossing the road 3 men on a bike abruptly stopped in front of us. They literally almost hit us. When we told them to look and drive they started catcalling us. And they even followed us until we reached the store. It really scared us too.

I was walking back to my hostel alone which was obviously not the best choice since the area wasn't really safe but I had no option. I saw one guy staring and whistling at me so I started walking faster because I was scared. After a few steps, another man who was in a car stopped right beside and told me to come inside his car. I was so scared that I literally started running and only stopped after I was inside my hostel. I then went and slept.

My group went for a picnic to the bannerghatta zoo. We randomly asked a man to click us a group photo. However, one of my friends was quick to notice that he started following us after that. I shrugged it off thinking since everyone was moving in the same direction it musn't be true. H=But my friend was persistent and said we should check by changing directions and we did. The man really was following us. He also came to me and asked me if I could click a picture for him, I did. But he asked me to be in his selfie afterwards to which I said no but he kept requesting and tried to click one anyways. Me and my friends walked away while he was talking and left the zoo altogether.

We were shopping for our monthly ration. It was really crowded that day for some reason. While I was going to another isle a man literally pushed me aside. I wouldn't have been too riled up about it if he didn't actually keep his whole palm on my chest. I confronted him and asked who gave him the permission to touch anyone's body let alone their chest. He said something in Kannada which definitely wasn't an apology. Just when I was about to shout, my friend told me to leave it alone because honestly we couldn't do anything. We both glared at him and walked past him.

It was my my pal's birthday so went to celebrate. The place was a little crowded since it was the weekend. We were all dancing in a group when I felt someone touch my waist. I quickly turned around to find an unknown man smiling at me. He tried to talk to me and asked me if he could buy me a drink but I told him that I don't drink and am not interested. But even after that, he kept pestering me and kept touching my waist. One of my guy friends told him to leave. He left. Later when I was coming out of the washroom I saw him just standing there and he tried to talk again while reaching for my waist. I told him no but he wouldn't listen. Thankfully one of friends came by just at that moment. My friend threatened to report him to the bouncers. We went home afterwards.

Me and my friends went clubbing. We were drinking and enjoying ourselves. I took a break and sat down when a girl came and kissed my cheek out of nowhere. I said "excuse me, what are you doing?" but she didn't reply and instead sat on lap. I quickly stood up due to which she fell. She started abusing. I just left.

I was roaming around on church street and saw a book stall. I was looking at some books when I felt a man brush his whole front against me. I turned around to look but he was already leaving.
