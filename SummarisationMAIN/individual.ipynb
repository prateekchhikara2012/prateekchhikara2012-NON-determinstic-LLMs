In single-party consent states, obtaining the employee’s consent is sufficient. In dual-consent states, however, the business must also inform the other party that the call may be monitored or recorded. The best practice is employee consent via a signed policy and notifying the other party as part of any phone call, to cover all bases,” he says. Interestingly, video surveillance has fewer restrictions, and these are generally concerned with the audio element. “There are no legal issues directly implicated by video recording, provided that the video surveillance does not offensively invade an employee’s privacy,” says Hyman. “State and federal wiretap laws do not cover pure video surveillance. As long as the surveillance is video-only (no sound), employers are generally okay.”', 'While I was waiting for a bus at the bus stop , a person was staringly looking at me. it was looking like intentionlly my body up and down .

In dual-consent states, however, the business must also inform the other party that the call may be monitored or recorded. The best practice is employee consent via a signed policy and notifying the other party as part of any phone call, to cover all bases,” he says.

In single-party consent states, obtaining the employee’s consent is sufficient. In dual-consent states, however, the business must also inform the other party that the call may be monitored or recorded. The best practice is employee consent via a signed policy and notifying the other party as part of any phone call, to cover all bases,” he says. Interestingly, video surveillance has fewer restrictions, and these are generally concerned with the audio element. “There are no legal issues directly implicated by video recording, provided that the video surveillance does not offensively invade an employee’s privacy,” says Hyman. “State and federal wiretap laws do not cover pure video surveillance. As long as the surveillance is video-only (no sound), employers are generally okay.”', 'While I was waiting for a bus at the bus stop , a person was staringly looking at me. it was looking like intentionlly my body up and down .

In single-party consent states, obtaining the employee’s consent is sufficient. In dual-consent states, however, the business must also inform the other party that the call may be monitored or recorded. The best practice is employee consent via a signed policy and notifying the other party as part of any phone call, to cover all bases,” he says. Interestingly, video surveillance has fewer restrictions, and these are generally concerned with the audio element. “There are no legal issues directly implicated by video recording, provided that the video surveillance does not offensively invade an employee’s privacy,” says Hyman. “State and federal wiretap laws do not cover pure video surveillance. As long as the surveillance is video-only (no sound), employers are generally okay.”\n",

In single-party consent states, obtaining the employee’s consent is sufficient. In dual-consent states, however, the business must also inform the other party that the call may be monitored or recorded. The best practice is employee consent via a signed policy and notifying the other party as part of any phone call, to cover all bases,” he says. Interestingly, video surveillance has fewer restrictions, and these are generally concerned with the audio element. “There are no legal issues directly implicated by video recording, provided that the video surveillance does not offensively invade an employee’s privacy,” says Hyman. “State and federal wiretap laws do not cover pure video surveillance.

In single-party consent states, obtaining the employee’s consent is sufficient. In dual-consent states, however, the business must also inform the other party that the call may be monitored or recorded. The best practice is employee consent via a signed policy and notifying the other party as part of any phone call, to cover all bases,” he says.

In dual-consent states, however, the business must also inform the other party that the call may be monitored or recorded. The best practice is employee consent via a signed policy and notifying the other party as part of any phone call, to cover all bases,” he says.

In single-party consent states, obtaining the employee’s consent is sufficient. In dual-consent states, however, the business must also inform the other party that the call may be monitored or recorded. The best practice is employee consent via a signed policy and notifying the other party as part of any phone call, to cover all bases,” he says. Interestingly, video surveillance has fewer restrictions, and these are generally concerned with the audio element. “There are no legal issues directly implicated by video recording, provided that the video surveillance does not offensively invade an employee’s privacy,” says Hyman. “State and federal wiretap laws do not cover pure video surveillance. As long as the surveillance is video-only (no sound), employers are generally okay.”\n",

      "**Legal Information on Workplace Monitoring**: Wiretapping laws require consent... ------> Wiretapping laws require consent,” says Ohio employment attorney Jonathan Hyman, a partner in the Labor & Employment Group at Kohrman Jackson & Krantz. “Therefore, employers cannot make recordings of telephone calls without consent. In single-party consent states, obtaining the employee’s consent is sufficient. In dual-consent states, however, the business must also inform the other party that the call may be monitored or recorded. The best practice is employee consent via a signed policy and notifying the other party as part of any phone call, to cover all bases,” he says. Interestingly, video surveillance has fewer restrictions, and these are generally concerned with the audio element. “There are no legal issues directly implicated by video recording, provided that the video surveillance does not offensively invade an employee’s privacy,” says Hyman. “State and federal wiretap laws do not cover pure video surveillance. As long as the surveillance is video-only (no sound), employers are generally okay.”\n",

In single-party consent states, obtaining the employee’s consent is sufficient. In dual-consent states, however, the business must also inform the other party that the call may be monitored or recorded. The best practice is employee consent via a signed policy and notifying the other party as part of any phone call, to cover all bases,” he says. Interestingly, video surveillance has fewer restrictions, and these are generally concerned with the audio element. “There are no legal issues directly implicated by video recording, provided that the video surveillance does not offensively invade an employee’s privacy,” says Hyman. “State and federal wiretap laws do not cover pure video surveillance. As long as the surveillance is video-only (no sound), employers are generally okay.”', 'While I was waiting for a bus at the bus stop , a person was staringly looking at me. it was looking like intentionlly my body up and down .

      "**50** - A man sexually assaulted me at a party ------> Wiretapping laws require consent,” says Ohio employment attorney Jonathan Hyman, a partner in the Labor & Employment Group at Kohrman Jackson & Krantz. “Therefore, employers cannot make recordings of telephone calls without consent. In single-party consent states, obtaining the employee’s consent is sufficient. In dual-consent states, however, the business must also inform the other party that the call may be monitored or recorded. The best practice is employee consent via a signed policy and notifying the other party as part of any phone call, to cover all bases,” he says. Interestingly, video surveillance has fewer restrictions, and these are generally concerned with the audio element. “There are no legal issues directly implicated by video recording, provided that the video surveillance does not offensively invade an employee’s privacy,” says Hyman. “State and federal wiretap laws do not cover pure video surveillance. As long as the surveillance is video-only (no sound), employers are generally okay.”\n",
